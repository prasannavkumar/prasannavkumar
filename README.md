About me :

CS Graduate with 6 years of experience spanning across industry, research and academia.

🎓 : 

MMath in CS (University of Waterloo) 

B Tech in CSE (Amity University)
      
I am passionate about building clean and responsive code and I enjoy finding creative solutions to both existing problems and emerging challenges, from front-end that shapes user experience to backend automation flow. 

I enjoy building things and I have a strong interest in front-end development: crafting what impacts users experience with technology feels like one of the most meaningful expressions of what makes computer science so beautiful. While I’ve worked on areas like API misuse and privacy in the cloud, what excites me most is hands-on coding and solving practical problems with thoughtful, maintainable solutions.
